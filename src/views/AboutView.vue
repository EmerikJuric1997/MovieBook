        <p class="project">
          This project was fully made by me(all the frontend, and backend) using
          <a href="https://www.omdbapi.com/" class="project">this api.</a> In this project I
          made auth with firebase and you can search all of your favourite
          movies and see ratings, plot and many more. For the backend I used
          firebase and for the frontend vue, vuetify, vuesax, html, css and
          google fonts. If you want to know how I made it you can contact me on
          social media, and we can also do some projects togehter and learn.
